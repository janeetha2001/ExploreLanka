    <td rowspan="4"><h2>Sigiriya Rock Fortress</h2>
      ___________________________________________________<br>

      <p align="justify"> The Sigiriya Rock Fortress, often referred to as Lion Rock or Sigiriya Citadel, is one of Sri Lanka’s most iconic archaeological treasures. Rising nearly 200 meters above the central plains, Sigiriya is considered one of the best-preserved examples of ancient urban planning in the world. Built in the 5th century AD by King Kashyapa, this UNESCO World Heritage Site remains a stunning fusion of natural geology and human ingenuity. Located in Sri Lanka’s Cultural Triangle, Sigiriya attracts thousands of visitors with its breathtaking views, frescoes, and advanced water gardens.</p>
      <h4>Tourist Attractions at Sigiriya</h4>
      <p align="justify"> Sigiriya offers a remarkable blend of history, engineering, and artistic brilliance. The entrance to the rock once featured a colossal stone lion, of which only the massive paws remain today—giving Sigiriya its name Lion Rock. The climb to the summit includes several attractions and features:</p>
      <ul>

In the 5th century AD, King Kashyapa seized the throne and moved the capital to Sigiriya for protection. He transformed the rock into a luxurious royal residence surrounded by landscaped gardens and defensive structures. After Kashyapa’s death in battle, Sigiriya became a Buddhist monastery until the 14th century.</p>

      <p align="justify">The Nine Arch Bridge was constructed during the British colonial period as part of the railway line connecting Ella with Badulla. Designed by British engineers and built by local craftsmen, the bridge is remarkable for its complete absence of steel.
